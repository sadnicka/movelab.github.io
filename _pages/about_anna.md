Anna Sadnicka started the Computational Movement Disorders Lab following the award of a [Wellcome Trust Early Career Award](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/discovery-research-schemes-remit).  Her belief that many of the big questions in movement disorders can only be approached by jumping into the multidimensional complexity of behaviour led her to train in methods within the community of the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) and her work is mentored by Maneesh Sahani. Experimental studies continue at purpose built labs at the Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders cementing motor control and neurophysiology expertise obtained during her PhD at UCL and Clinical Lectureship at SGUL.  

A Consultant Neurologist at the [National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-consultant/dr-anna-sadnicka) Anna sees patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders within a weekly teaching clinic led by Tom Warner.

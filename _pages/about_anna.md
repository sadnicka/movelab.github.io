Anna Sadnicka started the Computational Movement Disorders Lab following the award of a [Wellcome Trust Early Career Award](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/discovery-research-schemes-remit).  Her belief that many of the big questions in movement disorders can only be answered by jumping into the multidimensional complexity of behaviour led her to train in methods within the community of the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) and her work will be mentored by Maneesh Sahani. Experimental work continues at the purpose built labs at the Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders cementing motor control and neurophysiology expertise obtained during her PhD at UCL.  

A Consultant Neurologist at the [National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-consultant/dr-anna-sadnicka) Anna has a weekly teaching clinic seeing patinets with hyperkinetic movement disorders.

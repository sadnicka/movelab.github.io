Anna Sadnicka leads the Computational Movement Disorders Lab. Her [Wellcome Trust Early Career Award](https://wellcome.org/) allows us to work on pivotal clinical questions in movement disorders within the community of the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit). Her work is mentored by Professor Maneesh Sahani. 

Experimental studies are performed at purpose built labs at the [Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders] (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/research-departments/department-clinical-and-movement-neurosciences) cementing motor control and neurophysiology expertise obtained during her PhD at UCL and Clinical Lectureship at SGUL.  

A Consultant Neurologist at the [National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-consultant/dr-anna-sadnicka) Anna sees patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders within a weekly teaching clinic led by Professor Tom Warner.

Our mission is to understand how the brain breaks in human movement disorders with a particular focus on circuit-level mechanism.  Our methods include advanced behavioural quantification and neurophysiology and we use motor control theory, computational models and machine learning to understand the mathematics of the patterns we observe. Our research questions are based on current clinical needs striving to define causal mechanisms that inform neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation treatments.

Our mission is to understand human movement disorders with a focus on system-level mechanism so that our work can directly inform treatments such as neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation

Using neurophysiology techniques and advanced behavioural quantification we work collaboratively across the domains of motor control and computational neuroscience

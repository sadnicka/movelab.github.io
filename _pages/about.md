We seek to understand system-level mechanism in movement disorders.  Using advanced behavioural quantification and neurophysiology we draw on our expertise in motor control and computational neuroscience. As a multi-disciplinary group our work directly informs modes of neuromodulation such as deep brain stimulation and informs neurorehabilitation.

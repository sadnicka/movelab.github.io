Our mission is to better understand human movement disorders with a focus on system-level mechanism.  

Using advanced behavioural quantification and neurophysiology we work collaboratively across the domains of motor control and computational neuroscience. 

As a multi-disciplinary group our work directly informs modes of neuromodulation such as deep brain stimulation and neurorehabilitation!

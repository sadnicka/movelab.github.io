Welcome to the Computational Movement Disorders Lab!  Our goal is to better understand human movement disorders with a focus on system-level mechanism. Using neurophysiology techniques and advanced behavioural quantification we work collaboratively across the domains of motor control and computational neuroscience.  Research questions are based on current clinical needs and our work directly informs treatments such as neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation.

Anna Sadnicka leads the Computational Movement Disorders Lab. Her [Wellcome Trust Early Career Award](https://wellcome.org/) allows us to work on pivotal clinical questions in movement disorders within the community of the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit].(https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) Her work is mentored by Professor Maneesh Sahani. 

Experimental studies are performed at purpose built labs at the Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/research-departments/department-clinical-and-movement-neurosciences).

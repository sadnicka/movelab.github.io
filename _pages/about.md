Our goal is to better understand human movement disorders with a focus on system-level mechanism. 

Using neurophysiology techniques and advanced behavioural quantification we work collaboratively across the domains of motor control and computational neuroscience.  

Research questions are based on current clinical needs and our work directly informs treatments such as neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation.

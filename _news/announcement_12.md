If you are a person living with dystonia in the UK please consider taking part in our [survey](https://x.com/Krsampson1989/status/1822948098773012987) exploring experiences of physiotherapy.  The UK currently lags behind many regions of the world in terms of the quality and scope of physiotherapy and we need your perspectives on how we can try and improve this. Survey open until mid Jan 2025!

A huge thank you to all authors in our book [Basic and Translational Applications of the Network Theory in Dystonia](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-26220-3) just published with Springer.  This was co-edited with Asif Shaikh to collate a range of experimental papers and reflections from an international panel of experts that lead research on this important topic!

If you are a person living with dystonia in the UK please consider taking part in our [survey](https://x.com/Krsampson1989/status/1822948098773012987) exploring experiences of physio.  The UK currently lags behind many regions of the world in terms of the quality and scope of physio it offers.  Tell us your persepctives and help us to provide the evidence to start improving this.  Survey open until the end of November.
